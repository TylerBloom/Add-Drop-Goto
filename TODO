Need to add:
if waypoints.txt does not exist, clear jumps, posts, and waypoints
create a generalized arguement parse in place of the linear parse
add -c to clear all waypoints posts and jumps
add -r to rename a waypoint
add -h to help
process everything in the order it comes in, ie -a -l should be different than -l -a
